# stenographie AIFF #

A friend talked about how you could hide secret messages in image files by only changing the least significant bits.
I wondered if you could do the same with sound files and did some research into the AIFF file format.
I found a lot of helpful info about the structure of an AIFF file [here](http://www-mmsp.ece.mcgill.ca/Documents/AudioFormats/AIFF/Docs/AIFF-1.3.pdf).

In main.c I played around with some I/O in C, stenoaiff.c is the actual Programm.

This project is archived, as I want to start over in [steno-python](https://www.github.com/JimGerth/steno-python) and [steno-c](https://www.github.com/JimGerth/steno-c) respectively (when I get the chance to...).
